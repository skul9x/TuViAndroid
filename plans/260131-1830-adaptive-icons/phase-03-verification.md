# Phase 03: Verification
Status: ⬜ Pending
Dependencies: Phase 02

## Objective
Verify that the adaptive icon works correctly on the device/emulator.

## Test Criteria
- [ ] Icon fills the shape (circle/squircle) without white borders.
- [ ] Splash screen uses the background color correctly.
- [ ] Legacy devices (pre-Android 8) still show a valid icon (via `mipmap-hdpi` etc. or simple fallback).

## Notes
- May need to adjust scaling in XML if foreground is too big/small.
